# hand_gesture_detection
The project aims at building a machine learning model that will be able to classify the various hand gestures used for fingerspelling in sign language. 
Here, classification machine learning algorithms are trained using a set of image data and testing is done on a completely different set of data. 
For the image dataset, depth images are used, owing to the reduced pre-processing time.
